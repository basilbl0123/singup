* implement the signup page as described in the screenshots.

* logic for the "Sign up" button click event is as follows:
	1. all fields are validated. if all are valid then show an alert with the values of the fields.
	2. otherwise, an error message in red color is shown under the field (please leave enough space between the fields).
	3. if the button is clicked again after an invalid field has been corrected, the error message for that field should go away.

* validation rules for the fields and the error message for each case:
	1. name:
		* must not be empty. message: Your name must not be empty
		* must be exactly two parts (i.e. first name and last name). message: Your name must contain a first name and a last name
	
	2. email:
		* must not be empty. message: Your email must not be empty
		* must be valid email (i.e. must contain exactly one "@" and at least one dot "." after it, string before and after [@, .] must not be empty, hint: use split function). message: This is not a valid email address

	3. password:
		* must not be empty. message: Password must not be empty
		* must be at least 8 characters long. message: Password must contain at least 8 characters
		* must contain at least one number. message: Password must contain at least one number.
		* must contain at leas one of the following: [!, @, #, $, %, &, *].
